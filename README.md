# Pharmaceutical Room Environment Monitoring System

## Overview
The Pharmaceutical Room Environment Monitoring System is an Arduino-based solution designed to monitor temperature and humidity levels in pharmaceutical storage environments. Maintaining proper environmental conditions is essential to preserve the quality and safety of medicines.  

This system continuously measures temperature and humidity using a DHT sensor, displays real-time values on an LCD screen, and triggers a buzzer alert when humidity exceeds predefined safe limits. The project was designed and tested using the Wokwi online simulator.

## Objectives
- Monitor temperature and humidity in pharmaceutical storage areas  
- Display real-time environmental data  
- Provide alerts when humidity exceeds safe limits  
- Ensure proper storage conditions for medicines  
- Develop a low-cost and reliable monitoring system  

## Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring  
- LCD display for live readings  
- Automatic buzzer alert for high humidity  
- Simple and cost-effective design  
- Suitable for pharmaceutical environments  

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- DHT11/DHT22 Sensor  
- 16x2 I2C LCD Display  
- Buzzer  
- Breadboard  
- Jumper wires  

## Working Principle
1. The DHT sensor measures temperature and humidity.  
2. Arduino reads and processes the sensor data.  
3. The LCD displays real-time values.  
4. If humidity exceeds the preset threshold, the buzzer is activated.  
5. When levels return to normal, the buzzer turns off.

## Simulation and Testing
The system was designed and tested using the Wokwi online simulator before hardware implementation.
